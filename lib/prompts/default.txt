### **2. TITLE**
- Examples: {{resumeTitle}}

---

### **3. SUMMARY** (5-6 lines, 8-12 JD keywords + 3-5 domain keywords)

**Structure:**
- **Line 1:** {{resumeTitle}} with {{yearsOfExperience}}+ years in [domain from JD] across startup and enterprise environments
- **Line 2:** Expertise in [domain keyword] + [3-4 EXACT JD technologies WITH versions if specified]
- **Line 3:** Proven track record in [domain keyword] + [key achievement with metric: %, $, time, scale]
- **Line 4:** Proficient in [3-4 more JD technologies/methodologies]
- **Line 5:** [Soft skill from JD] professional with experience in [Agile/leadership/collaboration] in fast-paced environments
- **Line 6:** Strong focus on [2-3 key JD skill areas] and delivering scalable, production-ready solutions

**Example (FinTech):**
"Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years building scalable fintech platforms. Expertise in **payment processing systems**, **PCI-DSS compliance**, React.js 18, Node.js 20, and PostgreSQL. Proven track record implementing **fraud detection algorithms** that reduced chargebacks by 40% and processed $500M+ annually. Proficient in AWS infrastructure, Docker, Kubernetes, and **KYC/AML compliance frameworks**. Collaborative problem-solver with experience leading cross-functional teams in fast-paced startup environments. Strong focus on secure payment infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and delivering high-performance financial applications."

---

### **4. SKILLS** (60–75 total skills across 6–7 categories, prioritizing JD keywords over breadth.)

**Rules:**
- Create categories based on JD focus (Frontend, Backend, Cloud, DevOps, Security, etc.)
- 8-12 skills per category
- The categories MUST contain skills technically correct. "e.g.: Node.js or .NET is not programming language"
- Capitalize first letter of each skill
- NO version spam: "React.js" NOT "React.js 18, React.js 17, React.js 16"
- NO database spam: "PostgreSQL" NOT "PostgreSQL 15, 14, 13"
- Group cloud services: "AWS (Lambda, S3, EC2, RDS)" NOT 25 separate items
- 70% JD keywords + 30% complementary skills

**Example (Full Stack Engineer):**
```json
"skills": {
  "Frontend": ["React.js", "Next.js", "TypeScript", "JavaScript", "Tailwind CSS", "Redux", "Vue.js", "HTML5", "CSS3"],
  "Backend": ["Node.js", "Express.js", "Python", "Django", "FastAPI", "GraphQL", "REST APIs"],
  "Databases": ["PostgreSQL", "MongoDB", "Redis", "MySQL", "Elasticsearch"],
  "Cloud & Infrastructure": ["AWS (Lambda, S3, EC2, RDS, CloudFront)", "Docker", "Kubernetes", "Terraform"],
  "DevOps & CI/CD": ["GitLab CI/CD", "GitHub Actions", "Jenkins", "Datadog", "Prometheus"],
  "Testing": ["Jest", "Cypress", "Playwright", "React Testing Library"],
  "Payment & Compliance": ["PCI-DSS", "Payment processing", "Stripe", "Fraud detection", "KYC/AML", "SOC 2"],
  "Tools": ["Git", "Webpack", "Vite", "Figma", "Jira"]
}
```
Total: ~70 skills (scannable and professional)

**If relevant, create domain-specific category:**
- FinTech → "Payment & Compliance"
- Healthcare → "Healthcare Compliance & Standards"
- Security → "Security & Identity"
- Data → "Data Governance & Compliance"

---

### **5. EXPERIENCE** ({{experienceCount}} entries, 6-8 bullets each)

**Requirements:**
- Generate {{experienceCount}} job entries matching work history
- 6-8 bullets per job (most recent jobs get 8, older jobs 7)
- 40–50 words per bullet correctly, optimized for clarity and natural senior-engineer tone.
- For each work experience, ensure all technologies listed were widely available and commonly used in production during that role's time period; do not include tools, frameworks, or practices released after the role ended or unlikely to have been adopted in that era.
- Include 2-4 JD keywords per bullet
- EVERY bullet needs a metric (%, $, time, scale, users)
- Metrics have to be approximate. Use ranges or natural phrasing (e.g., '~40%', 'significant reduction', 'hundreds of thousands of users') when precise figures may feel unnatural. Ensure at least 50–60% of bullets include a metric, while the remainder focus on scope, ownership, or architectural impact.
- Add industry context to 2-3 bullets per job
- Prioritize JD keywords by frequency in the following order: Job Title > Core Technologies > Domain Compliance > Soft Skills.

**Bullet Structure:**
[Action Verb] + [JD Technology] + [what you built] + [business impact] + [metric]

**Action Verbs:**
✅ USE: Architected, Engineered, Designed, Built, Developed, Implemented, Optimized, Enhanced, Led, Spearheaded, Automated, Deployed
❌ AVOID: "Responsible for", "Duties included", "Tasked with", "Worked on"

**Industry Context Examples:**
- Amazon → "for e-commerce recommendation system"
- Stripe → "for fintech payment platform"
- Salesforce → "for B2B SaaS customers"
- If unknown → use JD company's industry or default to "SaaS platform"


**Example Bullet (with domain keywords):**
"Architected **secure payment processing system** using **PCI-DSS compliant** infrastructure with Node.js 20, PostgreSQL, and Redis, implementing **fraud detection algorithms** and **tokenization** that processed $500M+ annually while reducing chargebacks by 40% and maintaining 99.99% uptime for 2M+ users."
